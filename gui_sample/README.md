This page will give you a brief overview of how FileCase works. You will find samples of original files and their compressed/decompressed or encrypted/decompressed versions in [the test folder.](https://github.com/lounotlew/FileCase/tree/master/test)

**Main interface for FileCase.**

The main menu for FileCase. Has options to load a file that the user would compress/decompress or encrypt/decrypt, and buttons that actually compress/decompress or encrypt/decrypt the chosen file. Files to be compressed or encrypted must be ``.txt`` or ``.docx`` files, and will be saved as ``.bin`` files. Files to be decompressed/decrypted must be ``.bin`` files, and will be saved as ``.txt`` or ``.docx`` files, depending on the original file.
